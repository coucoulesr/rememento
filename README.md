# Rememento

Rememento is an app that reminds your loved ones how much you care. We let you send automatic daily text reminders to let them know you're thinking of them.

Visit rememento.com to see the production deploy of this project. Remento was designed, developed, and deployed with love and free of charge by Richard Coucoules. To see more of my work, please go to www.racoucoules.com.

## Stack

Rememento is built using React + Redux and interfaces with a tailor-made Express backend with MongoDB integration.

Rememento integrates the Twilio API to send and receive messages. 

## Source Code

The source code for the React frontend is available in this GitHub repo and the published code is free for analysis, dissemination, and reproduction.

The code in this repo references an APIURL property that I have chosen not to include; this project may still be built on remote machines by adding a config.js file with a default export APIURL string into the 'src' folder, through the dashboard will be unavailable without a functioning backend.
